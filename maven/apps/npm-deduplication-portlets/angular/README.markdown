# Angular npm Deduplication Sample

The Angular npm Deduplication sample provides a portlet that uses the
[Angular](https://angular.io/) framework to render its output. This is done by
providing a deduplicated instance of the Angular framework as an OSGi bundle and
then leveraging it from a sample portlet.
